Maybe I'm optimistic and tired but I've held for over two years and I can't see how Link proving functionality and gaining adoption in the middle of the bull cycle won't cause extreme upward movement. Maybe after the cycle it corrects down to a more \"reasonable\" valuation but I don't see why it doesn't mean the sky is the limit for the next 9 or so months\n",
