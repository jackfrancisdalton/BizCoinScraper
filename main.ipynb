      ">>27634271Aquabounty has a long history, in 1989 Researchers at Memorial University succeeded in using advanced genetics to develop an Atlantic salmon that grows faster during the early, most vulnerable stages of growth. This breakthrough innovation done once and conventionally spawned ever since, shortens the time cycle from hatch to harvest. Then in 2003 the first regulatory study was submitted to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Fast forward to 2009 and when the FDA approves AquaBounty Canada’s hatchery. Next the FDA concludes AquAdvantage Salmon are physically the same as Atlantic salmon; safe to eat; and poses no threat to the environment when farmed in land-based contained farms. In 2015 the FDA also approved AquaBounty Salmon. AQB has a good reputation when it comes to abiding by the law concerning bioengineered foods and supported a national mandatory standard in the U.S. for disclosing bioengineered foods in 2016. Over the next few years, 2017 through 2020, AQB built and began harvesting fish at their Indiana farm.Significantly increasing profitability for salmon farming in land-based Recirculating Aquaculture Systems (“RAS”)$17 billion1 global salmon market driven by a massive supply-demand imbalance and increasing need for fresh and nutritious proteins for a growing global populationAAS offers superior economics vs. conventional salmon by enabling 70% more harvest output while using 25% less feed – expected to provide EBITDA margins 2x higher than conventional salmon in land-based farmsSuccessfully completed first harvest of conventionalsalmon in June 2020 and will ramp up monthly harvest throughout end of 2020 and reach 100 metric tons per month by early 2021.\n",

They're not buying because it's healthy since it clearly isn't. I find the idea that vegans/vegetarians choose it because it tastes like meat (it doesn't) but isn't meat strange and insufficient to explain it. I and many others also noticed that they were always at full stock even while meat was gone in every supermarket.AQB at least makes sense on its head: note that I would never, not in a million year, eat AQB fish knowingly, but they can provide far cheaper fish to the masses when wild fish supplies are harder to get to and demand grows. They also did the market research showing at least half of people are potential long-term AQB customers if they can be profitable while hitting the right price.\n",
