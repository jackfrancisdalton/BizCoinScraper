But because enough of the population there have private ownership. There is not enough private ownership in the US atm to make seizure accomplish anything. So its a non point.For those asking about buying pm with crypto most bullion banks accept BTC, bitcoin cash, ETH, XRP and some others occasionally. You just got to ask.T- work in pm\n",

When the silver squeeze is explained to a boomer something different happens than when you explain the Gamestop situation... they get it.One of the higher ups moved his modest trading account over. One of the owners came to be because he's bleeding in his boomer index funds and he needs to put a million somewhere \"safe\". This silver thing is going to work, but the time hasn't come yet.

      "Physical silver is something everyone should be holding, but emptying retail inventory is NOT going to trigger any squeezes. But everyone buying PSLV like they did GME (and definitely options) will force Eric Sprott to have to go stand for delivery on COMEX in order to rebalance the fund. Him taking large delivery definitely could contribute to a squeeze. So PSLV is really the pain point. It's why Robinhood has delisted it while you can still get SLV. SLV is a scam and thy will issue as much paper to soak up the attack without every needing physical. PSLV is legit and if there is enough demand for it, Sprott WILL stand for massive delivery and put big pressure on COMEX.\n",

In order to recover your keys you will have to follow each of the following steps word-for-word, any deviation will result in your keys being lost forever. First I need you to ensure that you can follow each of the instructions I can lay out carefully; and maintain your composure in being able to determine when you are unable to follow these instructions. Losing your composure in determining when you are unable to determine when you cannot follow these instructions can spell mishap; I repeat mishap.
